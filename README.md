This is simple Rails application that I created to learn the basics of Hotwire. It uses `docker` to run the needed data sources such as `postgresql` and `redis`

## How to run
NOTE: You'll need to setup docker and docker-compose to start.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `docker compose up -d --build`, this will run all images.
3. Visit `localhost:3000`
